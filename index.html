<div class="content">
    <div class="start">Cene is a programming language dedicated to simplifying the experience of programming on all fronts.</div>
    
    <div class="isnt-enough n1">
        <div class="isnt-enough">It isn't enough for Cene to be a language that's easy to use.</div>
        <div class="why-not-enough">Some of the most arcane techniques in programming have come about because it's been even harder to go without them.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="isnt-enough n2">
        <div class="isnt-enough">It isn't enough for Cene to be simple within a well-defined problem domain.</div>
        <div class="why-not-enough">Much of the complexity of programming comes about when a project crosses domains and has to make various tools work together.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="isnt-enough n3">
        <div class="isnt-enough">It isn't enough for Cene to be a good tool for today's programmers.</div>
        <div class="why-not-enough">It must also be simple for those personally affected by Cene software to take ownership of their stake, including future generations who may have trouble dealing with Cene's technicalities or dated assumptions.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="dropping-the-beat n1">Cene isn't enough.</div>
    <div class="dropping-the-beat n2">Perhaps no language can be enough.</div>
    <div class="dropping-the-beat n3">And Cene has been designed with that in mind.</div>
    
    <div class="tour first">Thanks to Cene's <b>macros and namespaces</b>, tools that appear to be built into the language can turn out to be libraries, so Cene is not anchored to its old design decisions.</div>
    
    <div class="tour">Thanks to Cene's <b>quasiquotation and string quasiquotation</b>, it's easy to write Cene code that generates code that a fork of Cene can load.</div>
    
    <div class="tour">Thanks to Cene's <b>"<code>follow-heart</code>" operation</b>, some of a program's decisions are explicitly left up to the user and their chosen Cene implementation, so a program doesn't have to be set in its ways. This has the potential to release pressure that could have otherwise driven other parts of the language semantics to be subjective or complicated. With the resulting simplicity, we hope for Cene to be about as easy to standardize as Scheme or SML.</div>
    
    <div class="where-to-go">
        <p>Interested in using Cene? The readme at <a href="https://github.com/era-platform/cene">the GitHub repo</a> has a somewhat more in-depth introduction with instructions, and there's <a href="https://github.com/era-platform/cene-scaffold">a sample project</a> you can take a look at to get started. Cene isn't exactly stable yet, and we're working on improving the error messages in the experimental <a href="https://github.com/era-platform/cene-for-racket">Cene Mk. II</a> project, but it can be useful with enough patience. If you run into errors, try debugging the language implementation in the Node.js inspector, or open an issue on GitHub.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="thanks">Thanks for stopping by! Cene ya later.</div>
