Low-level Cene tasks, in roughly the order of the Sphinx documentation table of contents:


Add a `follow-heart` operation, and implement `err` in terms of it. More details about this are already described in a TODO.
Change `contributing-only-to` to accept a collection (e.g. a table) of namespaces-with-holes-in-them, rather than a single namespace.
Consider renaming "type" to "constructor," "struct," and "tag" throughout.

Update the various built-in macros that accept names of the form `(istring-nil <string>)` or `(foreign <name>)` to instead accept `(istring-nil <string>)`, `(foreign/obtain-by-name <name>)`, or `(foreign/obtain-directly <value>)`. Discontinue support for `(foreign <name>)`.

Implement a non-macro version of `case`: Given a constructor tag, a "subject" compiled expression, a one-to-one table from projection names to local variable names, a "then" compiled expression, and an "else" compiled expression, obtain another compiled expression with all the free variables of "subject" and "else" and all but the given local variable names out of the free variables of "then."
Implement non-macro versions of each of `def-struct` construction, `dex-struct`, `merge-struct`, and `fuse-struct`: Given a constructor tag and an ordered association list from mutually unique projection names to compiled expressions, obtain another compiled expression with the union of their free variables.
Implement a non-macro version of `c`: Given a "func" compiled expression and an "arg" compiled expression, obtain another compiled expression with the union of their free variables.
Implement a non-macro version of `compile-expression` on a variable access: Given a local variable name, obtain a compiled expression with just that variable in its free variables.
Implement a non-second-class version of `function-implementation-opaque`: Given any value, obtain a compiled expression with no free variables.
Implement a non-macro version of `defn`: Given an local variable name and a compiled expression with no free variables other than that one, obtain a "native definition" value. This value should not be directly callable (to prevent reflection at run time), but it can be installed in the namespace.
Implement a non-macro version of `let`: Given a "bindings" ordered association list from mutually unique local variable names to compiled expressions, and given a "body" compiled expression, obtain another compiled expression with the union of the "bindings" free variables and all but the given variables out of the free variables of "body."

Make `join-effects` into a merge, or at least a fuse. We might want it to be a fuse just because the performance of joining an effect to itself is inequal to the performance of the original effect.
Consider renaming "mode" to "world" throughout.
See if there's any real point to calling things "...-later", since errors that happen in the "later" portion are escalated to invalidate the prior portion anyway. Maybe we even want the mode to remain current across these operations. That could make it confusing when some operations change the mode and others don't.
Implement and use `committing-to-define` and `committing-to-define-function-implementations`.
Rename `test` to `test-sync`, and derive it in terms of `test-async`. Then rename `test-async` to `test`.
Get rid of namespace shadowing, unless we decide we need it again to achieve local macros.
Consider renaming `contributing-only-to` and the `committing-...` operations to `...-later`, since they "change" the current mode.
Reconsider the parameters to `macro-stx-details`. The mode really should be the current mode if the call is going to do anything with `unique-ns` and `definition-ns`, but why does it need those? It would probably be more relevant for this value to reify the identity of the macro definition itself, or at least contain a struct with a tag unique to that macro definition.
Implement `compile-expression` instead of having it built in. If it must be built in, consider whether it should be named `compile-expression-later` and whether it should conform to that calling convention.
Implement `read-all-force` instead of having it built in.
Consider making `int-compare` a dex, which would make it the first visibly ordered dex. If we ever want a merge for dexes, a dex like this could be a problem.
Refactor the entire "File I/O for simple builds" system so that it looks like it could use namespaces, but doesn't actually use any sub-namespaces the Cene code has access to.
Revisit `output-path-directory`, `output-path-utf-8`, and especially `cli-output-environment-variable-shadow` to be sure they behave as though they contribute to a namespace the user-level Cene code has no access to. Right now, I think `cli-output-environment-variable-shadow` outputs to a visible place in the definition namespace.
Implement the `--command` command line option.

Make a not-so-sloppy version of `sloppy-javascript-quine`. Namely, the implementation should walk the compiled expressions of the given struct tag's function implementation, find any constructor occurrences that occur in conditional locations that depend only on otherwise-seen constructor occurrences, and include all of their function definitions in the result. If any of their function definitions contain an embedded first-class value in a conditional location that depends only on seen constructor occurrences, those first-class values must be of only a few known types. (Add a way to extend the known types with any struct that the caller of this not-so-sloppy quine operation can deconstruct. That way we have an excuse as to why some values are supported and others aren't.)
Redesign `compile-function-js-effects` to a macro `js.\;qq[return 1 + 2;]` that creates a JavaScript effects value that executes the given code. The code is put into a `Function(...)` expression that's run at the time the program's JavaScript code first runs, rather than putting off the execution of `Function(...)` to the time these JavaScript effects are run. Hmm... One problem with this is that it's not well-defined what happens if more than one of these expressions has a syntax error.
Hmm. We probably want a way to construct JavaScript regexes at JavaScript load time too. We'll be able to do this in a sloppy way for a while, by generating compiled expressions that refer to macroexpansion-time first-class values, but maybe we should add another primitive so we don't have to mess with run time regexes until run time. Perhaps a macro `(js-early js-effects)` can cause the expression `js-effects` to be executed in an empty environment at compile time. Again, one problem with this is that it's not well-defined what happens if more than one of these expressions encounters an error.

For better error message behavior, be more careful about what paths in a `unique-ns` a macro call uses. By convention, paths used during calls to two different macros shouldn't collide, and paths used during two calls to the same macro should only collide in circumstances that can be comprehensively documented. Here are some examples of paths that would work well for the built-in macros:

  <unique-ns>/($$claimed-for claim:struct)/<constructor tag>/projection/<projection name>/...
    \= NOTE: This is a macro corresponding to a built-in constructor.
  
  \= NOTE: The `err` macro doesn't need to use its `unique-ns` at all.
  
  \= NOTE: These are for the upcoming redesign of `err`, not the current version.

  <unique-ns>/($$claimed-for claim:primitive let)/<set of variable names>/body/...
  \= NOTE: The `str` macro doesn't need to use its `unique-ns` at all.



--------

High-level Cene tasks, in roughly highest-priority-first order:


- Decide on a strategy for supporting lexically scoped extensions of the definition namespace. Local macros are the most immedate feature here, but we might want local constructor names too, and in general we might want local extensions of any user-defined macroexpansion-time framework. Although this achieves lexical scope, it is dynamic scope during the execution of macro implementations.

  Our approach was going to be namespace shadowing, but we've removed all other reasons to use namespace shadowing, and our current namespace layout isn't conducive to using shadowing for this local macro purpose.

- Right now, macro definitions often look up other macros from the definition namespace of the macro call. Make them look it up from the caller definition's definition namespace instead.

  If we don't want to embed first-class functions into the macro definitions, we'll have to have a macro lookup that results in a main tag of a nullary constructor of a function rather than resulting in a function. That way we can implement and use a new macro `(mac <source-macro-name>)` that uses this looked-up main tag to expand to a constructor call.

  Unfortunately, if the *only* macro lookup we have results in a constructor main tag, then `compile-expression` will have to somehow convert a main tag into a struct value. Or can it effectively do this already?

- Try to implement an example of an extensible framework (such as multimethods) in terms of the various "contribute" primitives.

- Implement the live service API described in live-services.txt.

- Implement proper error handling using a `do-what-you-think-is-best` operation instead of just terminating outright. Let people write something like (err a b c \;qq[message]) to call `do-what-you-think-is-best` using a parameter consisting of (list a b c), `str.\;qq[message]`, and an empty struct tagged with a name unique to this source code location.

- Design and implement a rich document format (ideally making the HTML ecosystem, plain text program code, and UI toolkits obsolete). A killer feature will be to have good support for keyboard navigation (if only for accessibility), selecting paren-unbalanced snippets, copying, and pasting.

- See if we should design a different approach to unit tests.

  - Perhaps the results should be installed as definitions somewhere.

  - Perhaps we should be able to control the order.

- Design and implement an approach to user-facing content localization. This is for arbitrary snippets of code, not just strings.

- Design and implement an approach to programmer-facing identifier and comment/whitespace localization.

- Write better documentation.

  - Finish documenting the built-in operations that don't have documentation yet.

  - Integrate the remaining documentation in docs.md into the docs. Especially focus on the part about the definition namespace layout.

- Implement a multi-backend compiler of Cene in Cene.

- See if we should offer a pure runner (like Haskell's ST monad) for `string-append-later` and similar side effects. Unfortunately, strings created inside such a runner could not be used outside until a later tick. They couldn't even be compared by `dex-string`, so they would hardly be strings at all. The runner could return an encapsulated value, but what would be the point? Maybe we would need another set of dex-like primitives to represent ways to export values from the runner. Exporting a string would usually force it, but there could be more than one way to export a string.

- Have the compiler do a dead code elimination pass.

- Design and implement a package manager with a simplistic module system.

- Devote some effort to polish and style.
