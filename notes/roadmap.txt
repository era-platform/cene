Cene tasks, in roughly highest-priority-first order:

- Try to implement an example of an extensible framework (such as multimethods) in terms of the various "contribute" primitives.

- Implement the live service API described in live-services.txt.

- Implement proper error handling using a `do-what-you-think-is-best` operation instead of just terminating outright. Let people write something like (err a b c \;qq[message]) to call `do-what-you-think-is-best` using a parameter consisting of (list a b c), `str.\;qq[message]`, and an empty struct tagged with a name unique to this source code location.

- Design and implement a rich document format (ideally making the HTML ecosystem, plain text program code, and UI toolkits obsolete). A killer feature will be to have good support for keyboard navigation (if only for accessibility), selecting paren-unbalanced snippets, copying, and pasting.

- See if we should design a different approach to unit tests.

  - Perhaps the results should be installed as definitions somewhere.

  - Perhaps we should be able to control the order.

- Design and implement an approach to user-facing content localization. This is for arbitrary snippets of code, not just strings.

- Design and implement an approach to programmer-facing identifier and comment/whitespace localization.

- Write better documentation.

  - Finish documenting the built-in operations that don't have documentation yet.

  - Subdivide the operations in docs.md based on topic.

- Implement a multi-backend compiler of Cene in Cene.

- See if we should offer a pure runner (like Haskell's ST monad) for `string-append-later` and similar side effects. Unfortunately, strings created inside such a runner could not be used outside until a later tick. They couldn't even be compared by `dex-string`, so they would hardly be strings at all. The runner could return an encapsulated value, but what would be the point? Maybe we would need another set of dex-like primitives to represent ways to export values from the runner. Exporting a string would usually force it, but there could be more than one way to export a string.

- Have the compiler do a dead code elimination pass.

- Design and implement a package manager with a simplistic module system.

- Devote some effort to polish and style.
