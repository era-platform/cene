Cene tasks, in roughly highest-priority-first order:

- Try to implement an example of an extensible framework (such as multimethods) in terms of the various "contribute" primitives.

- Implement a live service API as described in the "Implementing Blade" note in old-roadmap-notes.txt. This basically amounts to implementing lifelines.

- Cene's namespaces are going to have lots of functionality already, but see if we need to design any more LVar primitives according to the laws described in lvars.md.

- Design and implement a better unit test framework. The unit tests can now use dex values to do their comparisons, at least. We probably want to have control over the order unit test results are reported in.

- Implement proper error handling using a `do-what-you-think-is-best` operation instead of just terminating outright. Let people write something like (err a b c \;qq[message]) to call `do-what-you-think-is-best` using a parameter consisting of (list a b c), `str.\;qq[message]`, and an empty struct tagged with a name unique to this source code location.

- Design and implement a rich document format (ideally making the HTML ecosystem, plain text program code, and UI toolkits obsolete). A killer feature will be to have good support for keyboard navigation (if only for accessibility), selecting paren-unbalanced snippets, copying, and pasting.

- Design and implement an approach to user-facing content localization. This is for arbitrary snippets of code, not just strings.

- Design and implement an approach to programmer-facing identifier and comment/whitespace localization.

- Write better documentation.

  - Finish documenting the built-in operations that don't have documentation yet.

  - Subdivide the operations in docs.md based on topic.

- Implement a multi-backend compiler of Cene in Cene.

- See if we should offer a pure runner (like Haskell's ST monad) for `string-append-later` side effects.

- Have the compiler do a dead code elimination pass.

- Devote some effort to polish and style.
